## [How To Build an Engaged Audience by Randall Kanna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=virjfVa2_L8)

### Why Do You Need an Engaged Audience

+ People who buy or subscribe want to have a connection to you
+ People want you to provide value to them and to provide value

### Exercise

+ What Is the Last Gumroad Product you bought?
+ Why did you buy it?
+ Did it solve a problem for you?
+ Has the creator added value for you?

### What we'll learn in this workshop


### First, What are you interested in?

+ What are you interested in?
+ What do you do in your spare time?
+ What do people generally ask you questions about?
+ What kind of audience do you want to build?
+ What are you truly excited about?

### Who is your audience?

+ Who are they?
+ 

### Building an Audience is All About Providing Value

+ People will buy it because it creates value for them.
+ Think of your audience, what do they need?
+ Try to identify three reasons why someone would follow you? 

### Start Small

+ e.g. engineers that were job hunting, build credibility and valuable content for that small niche
+ Create content that solves a problem for your audience

### Find a way for People to Find You

+ Make sure you aren't screaming into the abyss! How?
+ You need to find ways to exand your reach
+ find out where your audience is
+ where do they spend most of their time, indieHackers, facebook forums, others? E.g. Dev.to
+ Join the conversation if you can add value
+ find people on Twitter that are talking about what you are doing and add to the conversation

### Create Credibility

+ Do something interesting ... and write about
+ Create something valuable and give it away for free
+ Do something for your followers - something that isn't scalable forever, but helps your audience learn something valuable
+ Daniel Vasallo did free Twitter profile review, he provided value.

### Create Consistently

+ It's a tough thing, you need to be constantly adding to this, creating content every week and on a schedule
+ Set weekly goals for yourself
+ Try to repurpose content as much as is possible.

### Followers < Engagement

+ You want to focus on making your audience as engaged as possible
+ Always be providing value, respond to as many comments as you can, review content that does well
+ You want people to turn on notifications for whenever you post ... that is the goal

### Q & A

Did you do any sort of sales safari?

+ Experimenting with tweets - anything from junior job hunters to more experienced developers
+ You can also find someone who is doing well on social media, e.g. questions about job hunting for engineers, it was a good time to be posting job hunting resources. Looking at what other questions were being posted to other people's profiles can be helpful.

Twitter Recommendations

+ Keep a list of people you want to interact with on Twitter, only focus on those

Recommendations on Building Credibility

+ The best is learning in public
+ Randall went through a coding bootcamp, build in public is one way to go through this
