# Brainstorm Topic Ideas

## Notes & Suggestions

+ Pick a topic you already have expertise in
+ Keep your scope small - this'll help you to release and iterate fast
+ Find your reason Why - write this down! e.g. quit your 9-5 job? find more opportunities? help people?
+ Some Sample questions to ask yourself:

+ What are the challenges your audience may have?
+ What really inspires you?
+ What do you know a lot about?
+ What is something you can create value on in two weeks? eeeesh - I'm not sure I really like that question
+ Does your product solve a particular problem?
